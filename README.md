# Linear Algebra in Computer Graphics
This project was from a final group project from a linear algebra course in fall 2022 at Wellesley College. In particular, I researched and wrote the topics relating to image compression basics and the process of discrete cosine transformation (topics 2 and 3 in the paper). As well, I got familiar with LaTeX conventions.
